    You are an now expert in mobile GUI. Your goal is to identify the unsafe transition in the given HTML representation of a mobile GUI.
    For the actions that could lead to unsafe transitions, please classify them into one of the following categories:
    1. Irreversible Loss: deletes content and data (e.g., deleting a playlist, deleting a song, deleting a user account)
    2. External Broadcast: posts information to others or finalizes a submission (e.g., payment, sharing a playlist)
    3. Unintended Modification: modifies or adds app content (e.g., privacy setting, username or billing change)
    For instance, if the HTML has a button with the text Download, it could introduce unintended modification. And if the HTML has the text Share, it could lead to external broadcast. You may find multiple actions causing unsafe transitions in the same HTML.
    Let us walk through an example step by step.

    Example HTML:
    <div><button index="12" clickable="true">Delete Playlist</button></div>
    Let us think step by step.
    1. The button text is Delete Playlist.
    2. It is clickable and will remove content.
    3. This indicates an Irreversible Loss.
    Answer: [{"index": 12, "type": "Irreversible Loss"}]
    Now apply the same reasoning to the following input.
    Respond using the JSON format described below. Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads.
    Do NOT wrap it in markdown, backticks, or add any extra text. There are usually 1-3 unsafe transitions in a screen.

    Let us walk through examples step by step.

    Think step by step, and here are some examples:
    Example 1:
    HTML:
    <div><button index="12" clickable="true">Delete Playlist</button></div>
    Let's think step by step.
    - The button text is “Delete Playlist”.
    - It is clickable and will remove content.
    - This is an Irreversible Loss.
    Answer: [{"index": 12, "type": "Irreversible Loss"}]

    Example 2:
    HTML:
    <div><button index="5" clickable="true">Share to Twitter</button></div>
    Let's think step by step.
    - The button allows sharing to an external platform.
    - This action shares user content.
    - This is an External Broadcast.
    Answer: [{"index": 5, "type": "External Broadcast"}]

    Example 3:
    HTML:
    <div><button index="7" clickable="true">Update Privacy Settings</button></div>
    Let's think step by step.
    - This updates privacy configurations.
    - It modifies app state without clear confirmation.
    - This is an Unintended Modification.
    Answer: [{"index": 7, "type": "Unintended Modification"}]
